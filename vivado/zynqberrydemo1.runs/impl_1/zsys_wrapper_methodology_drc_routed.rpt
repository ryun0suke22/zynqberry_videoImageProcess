CKBF-1#1 Warning
connects_I_driver_BUFR  
The BUFG cell zsys_i/video_in/csi2_d_phy_rx_0/U0/clock_system_inst/usr_BUFG_inst I pin is driven by a BUFR cell zsys_i/video_in/csi2_d_phy_rx_0/U0/clock_system_inst/BUFR_inst.

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning

The latch zsys_i/video_out/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/RAMsel2_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin zsys_i/video_out/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/RAMsel2_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch zsys_i/video_out/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/RAMsel3_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin zsys_i/video_out/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/RAMsel3_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock zsys_i/video_out/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin zsys_i/video_out/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~ */COUPLER_INST/FIFO_INST/FIFO_INST/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/*rstblk*/*PRE*}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '36' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
